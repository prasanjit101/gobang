# Gobang game

##  Overview

The game has playing pieces called ‘stones’ where one player uses the black stones, and the other uses the black ones. The game kicks off with an empty board where participants take turns to place the stones on various vacant areas on the board. The black stones play first by being placed in the intersections of the lines, and once they have been placed on the board, they are not moved unless captured. Capture happens when a stone is surrounded by opponent’s stones in all the adjacent positions. Players start the game by staking their claims on parts of the board they want to occupy. At the end of the game, the players count the vacant intersections on their territory and add it to the number of stones captured. The player with the larger total becomes the winner.
